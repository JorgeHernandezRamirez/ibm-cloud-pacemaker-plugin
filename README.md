# IBM Cloud Pacemaker Plugin

This repository contains the IBM Cloud Pacemaker Plugin, which provides integration between IBM Cloud and the Pacemaker cluster resource manager. The plugin enables you to manage cloud resources and deployment within Pacemaker, allowing high availability for your applications in the IBM Cloud environment.

## Background

Pacemaker is an open-source high availability (HA) cluster resource manager that is widely used for managing resources in a cluster. The IBM Cloud Pacemaker Plugin extends Pacemakerâ€™s capabilities by adding support for managing IBM Cloud resources, providing an easy way to deploy cloud-based applications in a high-availability setup.

## Features

- Seamless integration with IBM Cloud.
- Ability to manage cloud resources directly from Pacemaker.
- High availability for applications running on IBM Cloud.
- Supports easy configuration and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- A working IBM Cloud account.
- Access to a machine capable of running Pacemaker.
- Installation of Pacemaker on the cluster.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gampel/ibm-cloud-pacemaker-plugin.git
   ```

2. **Build the Plugin**:
   Navigate into the cloned directory and build the plugin:

   ```bash
   cd ibm-cloud-pacemaker-plugin
   make
   ```

3. **Install the Plugin**:
   Depending on your setup, you may need to copy the plugin files to the appropriate directories used by Pacemaker:

   ```bash
   sudo cp <plugin-binary> /usr/lib/pacemaker/
   ```

   Replace `<plugin-binary>` with the actual binary name created during the build process.

4. **Configure the Plugin**:
   Configure the plugin to connect with your IBM Cloud account. You may have to define the necessary credentials and configurations in the Pacemaker configuration files.

## Usage

1. **Start the Pacemaker Service**:
   Ensure that your Pacemaker service is running. You can start it with:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start pacemaker
   ```

2. **Add Resources**:
   Use the Pacemaker command-line interface to add IBM Cloud resources. For example:

   ```bash
   crm configure primitive MyResource ibm-cloud [property=value]
   ```

   Replace `MyResource` and `[property=value]` with your resource name and properties accordingly.

3. **Monitor and Manage Resources**:
   You can monitor and manage your resources using standard Pacemaker commands:

   ```bash
   crm status
   crm resource show
   ```

4. **Failover and Recovery**:
   Pacemaker will automatically manage failover based on your configuration, ensuring high availability of your resources.
